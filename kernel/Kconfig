config KSU
	bool "KernelSU function support"
	depends on OVERLAY_FS
	default y
	help
	  Enable kernel-level root privileges on Android System.

config KSU_KPROBES_KSUD
	bool "Enable dynamic kprobes for early boot"
	depends on KPROBES
	default y
	help
	  Use dynamic hooks via kprobes for functions needed only
	  on early boot. Hooks are unregistered at boot complete
	  to reduce overhead.

config KSU_KRETPROBES_SUCOMPAT
	bool "EXPERIMENTAL: kretprobes for sucompat"
	depends on KRETPROBES
	default n
	help
	  EXPERIMENTAL: Use kretprobes for hooking getname_flags, mainly for
	  sucompat. This method will hijack all fs-related syscalls, but
	  thwarts timing based detections.

config KSU_DEBUG
	bool "KernelSU debug mode"
	depends on KSU
	default n
	help
	  Enable KernelSU debug mode.

config KSU_THRONE_TRACKER_ALWAYS_THREADED
	bool "Always run throne tracker in a kthread"
	default n
	help
	  Runs throne_tracker in a separate kthread, including the first run.
	  Significantly decreases boot time, but can cause crowning failure
	  on some FDE or FBEv1 setups.
	  If unsure, say n.

config KSU_ALLOWLIST_WORKAROUND
        bool "KernelSU Session Keyring Init workaround"
        depends on KSU
        default n
        help
          Enable session keyring init workaround for problematic devices.
          Useful for situations where the SU allowlist is not kept after a reboot.

config KSU_LSM_SECURITY_HOOKS
	bool "use lsm security hooks"
        depends on KSU
        default y
	help
	  Disabling this is mostly only useful for kernel 4.1 and older.
	  Make sure to implement manual hooks on security/security.c.
